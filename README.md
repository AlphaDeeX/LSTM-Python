# LSTM-Python
A pure Python and Numpy implementation of an LSTM Network.

This is a pure numpy and python implementation of an LSTM network. 


Required dependiencies are:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas (only if importing DataFrames)
 
The execution file is not commented as of yet, however the LSTM class object file has comments to understand what's happening. This is loosely based on a Gist by Karpathy.
